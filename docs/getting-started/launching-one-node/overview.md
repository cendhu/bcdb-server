A single Orion node can be started using one of the following two methods:
  1. `orion` binary executable - [Click Here](binary)
  2. docker container - [Click Here](docker)

For a simple setup, we can use the default configuration and crypto materials supplied in the `deployment/` directory of Hyperledger Orion repository.
<!-- For a complex setup with more users and nodes, refer to [creating crypto materials](crypto-materials). -->
